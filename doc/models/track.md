`Track`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `numSamples` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The exact number of audio samples analyzed from this track. See also `analysis_sample_rate`. |
| `duration` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | Length of the track in seconds. |
| `sampleMd5` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | This field will always contain the empty string. |
| `offsetSeconds` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | An offset to the start of the region of the track that was analyzed. (As the entire track is analyzed, this should always be 0.) |
| `windowSeconds` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The length of the region of the track was analyzed, if a subset of the track was analyzed. (As the entire track is analyzed, this should always be 0.) |
| `analysisSampleRate` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The sample rate used to decode and analyze this track. May differ from the actual sample rate of this track available on Spotify. |
| `analysisChannels` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The number of channels used for analysis. If 1, all channels are summed together to mono before analysis. |
| `endOfFadeIn` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The time, in seconds, at which the track's fade-in period ends. If the track has no fade-in, this will be 0.0. |
| `startOfFadeOut` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The time, in seconds, at which the track's fade-out period starts. If the track has no fade-out, this should match the track's length. |
| `loudness` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db. |
| `tempo` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. |
| `tempoConfidence` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the `tempo`.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
| `timeSignature` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of "3/4", to "7/4".<br>**Constraints**: `>= 3`, `<= 7` |
| `timeSignatureConfidence` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the `time_signature`.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
| `key` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard [Pitch Class notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class). E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.<br>**Constraints**: `>= -1`, `<= 11` |
| `keyConfidence` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the `key`.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
| `mode` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0. |
| `modeConfidence` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | The confidence, from 0.0 to 1.0, of the reliability of the `mode`.<br>**Constraints**: `>= 0`, `<= 1` |
| `codestring` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | An [Echo Nest Musical Fingerprint (ENMFP)](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8Q248M4) codestring for this track. |
| `codeVersion` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | A version number for the Echo Nest Musical Fingerprint format used in the codestring field. |
| `echoprintstring` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | An [EchoPrint](https://github.com/spotify/echoprint-codegen) codestring for this track. |
| `echoprintVersion` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | A version number for the EchoPrint format used in the echoprintstring field. |
| `synchstring` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | A [Synchstring](https://github.com/echonest/synchdata) for this track. |
| `synchVersion` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | A version number for the Synchstring used in the synchstring field. |
| `rhythmstring` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | A Rhythmstring for this track. The format of this string is similar to the Synchstring. |
| `rhythmVersion` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | A version number for the Rhythmstring used in the rhythmstring field. |
